      <description>Switching to Fedora 32 So I switched to Fedora 32 last week, after getting annoyed with Ubuntu 20.04 pushing snap-packages everywhere. Fedora has been a delight, although I&amp;rsquo;ve had several small hickups. I don&amp;rsquo;t blame Fedora for this, the problem is that I&amp;rsquo;ve grown accustomed to the ease of use of Ubuntu or Windows at the cost of using non-free software. Fedora ships only open source / free software in their standard package repositories which I think is a good thing.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my new website This is the first post on my new website using Hugo. Everything appears to work now. I&amp;rsquo;ve set this up as a static site, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about the latest php exploit or other vulnerabilities.
How it works The site is powered by Hugo, a static site generator. The content of the site is written in markdown and stored in a git repository.</description>
